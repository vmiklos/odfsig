= pdfiumsig

Example code, demoing how to use the set of pdfium signature APIs from
<https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/refs/heads/master/public/fpdf_signature.h>.

The test files:

- 2good.pdf: 2 good signatures. Technically the 1st signature doesn't cover the whole document, but
  it's considered as a complete signature at high-level.

- bad.pdf: digest mismatch

- good.pdf: matching digest

- partial-in-between.pdf: 1st signature is partial

- reason.pdf: custom signature reason

This is not complete signature verification, for example no verification of the x509 certificate is
done. NSS is used for crypto operations, mostly because that's what I (Miklos) am familiar with.
Could be anything else as well. ;-)
